## Recent Changes

| # | Date | Modification |
|---|------|--------------|
| 1 | 2026-02-16 | **Deep audit phase 13: Cardinality momentum + CCD ERC solver — 2 findings across 4 files**: (1) **CRITICAL: Cardinality MIQP/two_stage objectives drop momentum signal** (Roncalli 2013, Ch. 7) — SCA solver includes `ret_term = mu @ w` in its objective, but both `_enforce_miqp()` and `_enforce_two_stage()` build independent CVXPY problems that omit this term. Since `auto` resolves to `two_stage` with MOSEK, the default cardinality path erases all return-based tilts. This explains persistent selection_ratio=1.01 despite Phase 12 winsorization + momentum_weight=0.50. Phase 12 incorrectly rejected this finding, confusing mu *passing* (Phase 1 fix: mu added to sca_kwargs) with mu *usage* in objectives (never added to MIQP/two_stage). Added `ret_term = mu @ w_var` to both objectives. (2) **ERC CCD fallback solver** (Griveau-Billion, Richard & Roncalli 2013) — Newton solver fails for n=488 (Jacobian ill-conditioned, κ=24,000). Extended backtracking from 20→50 halvings. Added `_ccd_erc()` cyclical coordinate descent: solves fixed-point equation one coordinate at a time via quadratic formula, **guaranteed positivity** by construction for any PD Σ. Solver chain: CVXPY → Newton → CCD → 1/N. 4 files modified (cardinality.py, erc.py, test_benchmarks.py, test_portfolio_optimization.py), pyright 0 errors, 480 tests pass (5 new). |
| 2 | 2026-02-16 | **Deep audit phase 12: Momentum winsorization + Newton ERC solver — 2 findings across 3 files**: (1) **Momentum signal winsorization at ±3σ** (Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen 2013) — two-pass clip before z-scoring in momentum.py. Extreme negative outliers (z-score range [-7.86, 1.93]) were inflating cross-sectional std and compressing the positive tail, making momentum inert (selection ratio=1.01). After winsorization, z-scores are symmetric and the signal contributes meaningful tilts within the entropy-feasible region. (2) **Newton-based ERC fallback solver** (Roncalli 2013, Ch. 11, Algorithm 11.1) — added `_newton_erc()` as fallback between CVXPY solver chain and 1/N in erc.py. All three CVXPY solvers (MOSEK, ECOS, SCS) failed for n=636 stocks, making ERC identical to EW. Newton solver operates directly on the fixed-point equation (Σy)_i·y_i=1 with damped Newton steps and inverse-vol initialization. 3 files modified (momentum.py, erc.py, test_benchmarks.py), pyright 0 errors, 475 tests pass (7 new). |
| 3 | 2026-02-16 | **Deep audit phase 11: Alpha selection + PCA benchmark ENB fix — 2 findings across 4 files**: (1) **IMPORTANT: Min-variance among qualifying alphas** (Meucci 2009, DeMiguel et al. 2009) — `select_operating_alpha()` now picks the alpha with **minimum variance** among all qualifying points (ENB_mono ≥ target), instead of the smallest qualifying alpha. On U-shaped variance-entropy frontiers, the old logic selected alpha=0.005 (Var=6.22e-5) while alpha=2.0 was Pareto-dominant (-16.7% variance, +37.6% entropy). At low alpha entropy is too weak to diversify; at high alpha entropy forces factor diversification which reduces variance through correlation structure. (2) **BUG: PCA benchmark naive ENB target (INV-012 violation)** — PCA used `max(2.0, k/2)` = 15.0 for k=30, but ENB_spectrum=1.71 making target 8.8x unreachable → forced to extreme alpha → negative Sharpe (-0.006/-0.009). Extracted shared `compute_adaptive_enb_target()` function into frontier.py, used by both pipeline.py and pca_factor_rp.py. Formula: `max(2.0, min(n_signal/2, ENB_spectrum * 0.7))`. PCA benchmarks now produce positive Sharpe. 4 files modified (frontier.py, pipeline.py, pca_factor_rp.py, test_portfolio_optimization.py), pyright 0 errors, 468 tests pass (5 new). |
| 4 | 2026-02-16 | **Phase 10: Cardinality + momentum activation — 3 changes across 3 files**: (1) `_MAX_BINARY_VARS` 80→150 in cardinality.py — lifts MIQP ceiling to avoid fallback to greedy elimination for larger universes. (2) `momentum_enabled` False→True, `momentum_weight` 0.02→0.05 in config.py — activates momentum signal by default. (3) `np.asarray`→`np.array(copy=True)` in momentum.py — fixes read-only array error from pandas Series. |
| 5 | 2026-02-16 | **Phase 9 audit: 5 fixes across 5 files** (post-VAE portfolio + benchmarks): (1) **CRITICAL: Adaptive ENB target** (Meucci 2009, Roncalli 2013 Ch. 7) — replaced naive `n_signal/2` target with `min(n_signal/2, ENB_spectrum * 0.7)` where `ENB_spectrum = exp(H(eigenvalue_spectrum))` is the maximum achievable ENB for the current eigenvalue structure. (2) **BUG: Fallback argmax(enb_mono)** — `select_operating_alpha` fallback used raw `enb` instead of `enb_mono` (monotone envelope). (3) **INV-012: constraint_params complete** — added missing `w_bar` and `alpha_grid`. (4) **INV-012: effective_cap = min(w_bar, w_max)** in base.py and min_variance.py. (5) **DOC: ERC near-uniform warning**. 5+2 files modified, pyright 0 errors, 440 unit tests pass. |

(3) B_A_SHRINKAGE_ALPHA 0.15→0.0. (4) PCA benchmark frontier (INV-012). (5) ERC NaN handling. (6) var_ratio fillna(0)@w. (7) PHI 20→0.0. 5 files modified, pyright 0 errors, 440 unit tests pass. |
| 7 | 2026-02-15 | **Deep audit phase 7: 5 fixes across 5 files**: (1) w_old alignment by stock ID. (2) Bayesian VT shrinkage (Barra USE4). (3) entropy_idio_weight 0.2→0.05. (4) lstsq rank diagnostic. (5) Diversified frontier seeds. 5 files modified, pyright 0 errors, 77 unit tests pass. |
| 8 | 2026-02-15 | **Deep audit phase 6: 5 fixes across 5 files**: (1) ENB target on H_factor only (Meucci 2009). (2) DGJ/EWMA decoupled. (3) Per-factor VT (Barra USE4). (4) INV-012 turnover symmetry. (5) w_max/w_bar doc. 5 files modified, pyright 0 errors, 198 unit + 22 integration tests pass. |
| 9 | 2026-02-15 | **Deep audit phases 3-5: 19 fixes across 9 files**: Highlights: full Sigma_assets for risk (DGJ 2018), frontier returns weights, turnover tracking + net Sharpe (DeMiguel 2009), ENB monotone envelope, WLS regression (Fama-MacBeth 1973), disjoint VT holdout (Shephard-Sheppard 2010), hard concentration constraint (Jagannathan-Ma 2003), D_eps kurtosis correction, parametric CVXPY, factor regression lstsq, D_eps James-Stein corrected (Ledoit-Wolf 2004), B_A normalization ddof, H_norm_signal, Sigma_assets symmetrization. |
